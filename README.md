# physjigs

i put together another physics engine
i got very bored
instead of circles there are now cubes
collisions are still bad
i also broke everything like 5 min ago by writing comments in the file
but i assume its because i renamed the file from declarations to jqsx-lib
have fun idk i think its kinda cool
this project killed my computer's battery
